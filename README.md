This repository showcases my code for GT CS3451 - Computer Graphics class. The course covers a range of topics, including the mathematical foundations, GPU pipeline, shape representation, procedural modeling, physically-based simulation, character animation, shading, lighting, texturing, and realistic ray-tracing rendering.
