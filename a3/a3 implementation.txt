In order to implement my customized scene, I changed the background colors for the gradient then scaled up one of the grass models in order to create a ground. Then, in order to align the flamingo and statue correctly, I had to use different rotation matrices and multiplied them with scaling and translation matrices in the correct order to have them in the correct position and orientation.
