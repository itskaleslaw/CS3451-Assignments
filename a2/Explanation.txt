My technical implementation includes all three steps, which would be first updating the new vertex array to include the three new vertexes at the end of the array, then adding the four new faces to the new faces array. Next, we establish the the FindTheOtherVertex allows us to smooth the odd vertexes using the formula. Finally, SmoothEvenVtx uses another formula to smooth the even vertices based on the neighboring vertices, and we call this on every vertex in the old array (the even ones)
